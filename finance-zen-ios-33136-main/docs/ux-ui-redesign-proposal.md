# Finance Zen UX/UI Redesign Proposal

## Vision
Finance Zen becomes a calm, offline-first money coach that feels native on iPhone yet scales elegantly to desktop. Every screen answers two questions instantly: *Where does my money stand right now?* and *What should I do next?* The experience eliminates bookkeeping friction, celebrates healthy habits, and keeps all data on-device so users maintain full control.

---

## Guiding Principles
1. **One-look clarity** – Critical balances, remaining budget, and next actions are always visible without scrolling.
2. **One-tap actions** – The primary flows (log movement, fund cards, close month) require no more than a single prominent tap to start and three decisions or fewer to finish.
3. **Predictable structure** – Consistent component hierarchy, typography, and spacing establish muscle memory across screens.
4. **Transparent finance logic** – Every calculation can be inspected and edited, with tooltips exposing formulas and data sources.
5. **Offline assurance** – IndexedDB (with optional JSON export) stores everything locally; the UI never suggests an online dependency.

## Reimagined Experience (Screen by Screen)
### 1. Welcome & Onboarding
- **Screen 1: Calm welcome** featuring succinct promise (“Clarity every month”) and CTA "Start my plan".
- **Screen 2: Accounts snapshot** collects starting balances via sliders for Credit Card, Meal Card, Cash, Savings. Inline copy shows why each matters.
- **Screen 3: Obligations checklist** pre-fills recurring outflows (Rent, Savings transfer, Crypto allocations, Shit Money allowance) with editable defaults.
- **Screen 4: Plan confirmation** summarises cash flow outlook and savings goal progress, with “Activate month” primary button.

### 2. Dashboard (Default Landing)
- **Sticky status header**: remaining days, net cash flow, % essentials vs lifestyle, and quick celebratory microcopy (e.g., “Savings on track +€120”).
- **Monthly checklist card** (collapsible) prompting any pending onboarding tasks or reviews.
- **Action dock** (mobile bottom sheet / desktop right rail) with three primary buttons: `Log Movement`, `Fund Cards`, `Close Month`.
- **Spending overview**: segmented ring showing Essentials, Lifestyle, Investing; tapping reveals detail cards.
- **Timeline feed**: chronological list of movements with badges for category, account, and variance vs. plan.
- **Insights rail**: mini cards for Savings vs. Goal, Buffer health, Credit card payoff projection.

### 3. Log Movement Flow
- Single bottom sheet with segmented control for Income / Expense / Transfer.
- Progressive disclosure: selecting Expense reveals category chips (Rent, Food, Lazer, Crypto-Core, Crypto-Shit, Buffer, Transport, Health, Subscriptions, Other) plus quick-fill amounts from recent history.
- Confirmation screen shows resulting balances for affected accounts before saving.

### 4. Fund Cards Flow
- Short two-step sheet: Step 1 displays last month’s top-up and suggested amount based on plan. Step 2 confirms credit to Meal Card and Credit Card simultaneously, illustrating leftover salary.
- When saved, a success toast indicates updated balances and invites logging of the month’s first purchase.

### 5. Monthly Review & Close
- Celebratory summary card with confetti (respecting reduced motion) stating cash flow delta and savings achievements.
- Breakdown tables: Planned vs Actual for each category, plus highlight chips (“You underspent on Food by 12%”).
- Actions: `Roll over surplus`, `Move to savings`, or `Reset to zero` per account.

### 6. History & Trends
- Calendar heatmap for monthly surplus/deficit.
- Trend lines for Savings growth, Lifestyle spend, and Card utilization.
- Export button for JSON backup (offline compliant).

### 7. Settings & Transparency
- Preference toggles for currency, language, motion, biometric unlock.
- Formula browser listing each metric with editable parameters and “View calculation” modal referencing underlying movements.

## Visual System & Layout
### Palette
| Role | Color | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Background | `#10131A` | Deep navy charcoal to reduce glare |
| Surface | `#1B222C` | Cards, sheets, drawers |
| Primary accent | Gradient `#5BE7C4 → #4D7CFE` | Actions, progress bars |
| Positive state | `#6BEFA3` | Savings wins, confirmations |
| Caution state | `#FFB86C` | Upcoming bills, buffer alerts |
| Critical | `#FF6B6B` | Over-budget warnings |
| Text (primary/secondary) | `#F5F9FF` / `#A7B4CC` | High contrast, accessible |

### Typography
- **Family**: Inter (system-friendly and available via web).
- **Hierarchy**: H1 28/34 bold, H2 22/28 semibold, body 16/24 regular, caption 14/20 medium.
- **Numeric styling**: Tabular figures for all currency values; decimals aligned vertically.

### Grid & Spacing
- Base unit 8px; key rhythm 24px for sections, 16px for card padding, 12px for element spacing.
- Mobile: single column with sticky header + dock. Desktop: responsive two-column layout, 320px insights rail.

### Iconography & Illustrations
- Rounded duotone icons (teal/indigo). Onboarding uses simple geometric illustrations echoing currency symbols.

## Financial Architecture
### Core Entities
- **Account**: `id`, `name`, `type` (`credit`, `meal`, `cash`, `savings`, `crypto-core`, `crypto-shit`, `buffer`), `balance`, `limit` (optional).
- **Category Bucket**: `id`, `label`, `classification` (`essential`, `lifestyle`, `investment`, `buffer`), `defaultPlan` amount, `accountSource` (default funding account).
- **Monthly Plan**: `id`, `month`, `year`, references to `plannedInflow`, `plannedOutflow`, `plannedSavings`, `cardTopUps`, `targets` per category.
- **Movement**: `id`, `date`, `accountFrom`, `accountTo`, `category`, `amount`, `type`, `notes`, `isPlanned` flag.
- **Indicator Snapshot**: stored summary per month of calculated metrics for quick rendering.

### Key Formulas
- **Planned Income** = `Σ(defaultPlan.income)` + `cardTopUps.credit + cardTopUps.meal` + `extraInflow`.
- **Planned Essentials Spend** = `Σ(category.classification == essential ? targetAmount : 0)`.
- **Planned Lifestyle Spend** = `Σ(classification == lifestyle ? targetAmount : 0)`.
- **Savings Target** = `plannedSavings + plannedTransfersToSavings`.
- **Actual Spend by Category** = `Σ(movement.type == expense && movement.category == category)`.
- **Variance** = `actual - planned` (per category and totals).
- **Essential Spend Ratio** = `actualEssentials / actualIncome`.
- **Lifestyle Spend Ratio** = `actualLifestyle / actualIncome`.
- **Savings Completion** = `(actualSavings / savingsTarget)`.
- **Cash Flow** = `(startingBalances + actualIncome) - actualExpenses`.
- **Remaining to Spend** = `plannedEssentials + plannedLifestyle - actualExpenses` (bounded at zero).
- **Buffer Health** = `bufferAccount.balance / bufferTarget`.
- **Card Payoff Projection** = `creditAccount.balance - plannedPaydown` (displayed with due date badge).

All formulas surfaced via info icons, with inline “Edit target” buttons linking back to Monthly Plan settings.

## Simplified Flow: Input → Insight
1. **Capture** – User taps `Log Movement`, chooses type, selects category/account, confirms.
2. **Auto-reconcile** – Movement updates account balances and relevant bucket totals instantly.
3. **Compute** – Indicators recalculate in background, storing snapshot for dashboard tiles.
4. **Highlight** – Dashboard surfaces updated insights (e.g., “€180 remaining in Essentials”).
5. **Recommend** – If thresholds crossed (e.g., lifestyle ratio > plan), a gentle nudge appears with suggestion (“Freeze Shit Money for 3 days?”).

A ribbon at top shows progress dots (`Setup → Capture → Review`) to reassure new users.

---

## Onboarding & Monthly Review Logic
- **Onboarding** auto-launches until the first month is activated. Progress saves after each step, so closing the app resumes where left off.
- **Monthly rollover** triggers when the user taps `Close Month` or when the month changes. Flow: review summary → choose carryover per account → confirm next month’s plan (pre-filled with last targets + adjustments from insights).
- **Automation**: recurring expenses (Rent, Savings, Crypto, Shit Money) auto-post on day 1 as planned movements; user can edit amounts before confirmation.
- **Transparency**: summary shows how card top-ups converted into category funding and which balances remain.

---

## Behavioral Design & Motivation
- **Positive reinforcement**: microcopy celebrates actions (“Nicely done! Rent and Savings are locked in for the month.”).
- **Streaks**: monthly streak tracker for “Closed month on time” and “Stayed within essentials budget”. Visualized as glowing dots under header.
- **Goal nudges**: if savings completion < 80% midway through month, a gentle reminder suggests rebalancing categories.
- **Reflection prompts**: closing month asks a single optional question (“What worked well?”) stored locally for journaling context.
- **Calm alerts**: over-budget states shift card border to amber with guidance, never alarming red unless user is significantly overspent (>120% of plan).

---

## Accessibility & Usability Enhancements
- Minimum 48px touch targets, with generous spacing between primary actions.
- Full keyboard navigation supported; tooltips accessible via long-press or focus.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables confetti and uses fade transitions.
- VoiceOver/Screen Reader friendly: each card includes `aria-live="polite"` updates and concise labels (“Essentials 62% of income, €540 spent, €330 remaining”).
- High-contrast mode toggle shifts surfaces to `#0B0E13` and text to pure white.

---

## Interaction & Motion Examples
- **Header compression**: scroll down → header scales from 120px to 72px with eased height change and numeric count-up.
- **Action dock expansion**: tapping FAB morphs into segmented sheet over 240ms spring animation; background dims subtly to focus attention.
- **Checklist completion**: checkmark animates with 180ms stroke draw and haptic tick (on supported devices).
- **Trend hover**: desktop hover reveals tooltips sliding upward 12px with slight opacity fade.
- **Toast feedback**: slides from bottom, persists 2.5s, offers undo for movement deletion.

---

## Tone & Microcopy
- **Voice**: encouraging, concise, never preachy. Example headers: “Savings on pace”, “Buffer holding steady”.
- **Primary CTA labels**: action-focused (“Log expense”, “Fund my cards”, “Close this month”).
- **Empty states**: reassure users (“No movements yet—log your first expense to see insights spark to life.”).
- **Error handling**: empathetic (“Couldn’t save that movement offline? Try again—your data stays safe here.”).
- **Nudges**: collaborative tone (“Let’s keep Essentials under 60%—pause Lazer spending for two days?”).
